!! sort morph parts into higher tables umbrellas ("Breasts, Butts, Vaginas, Limbs, Mains") for proper welding and physics.

--Extra Morph Configs

edit adjustscale if you have werid positioning and sizing


create Physics and PhysicsRotationOffset subtables with XYZ values for custom physic spring rotation offsets

if your morph has no UV, set NoUV = true


the script will (attempt) to organize your parts based off names for functions such as UV and transparency order


make sure your part names have full words for correct sorting, such as, "Butt, Breast, UV, Leg, Arm, Texture"
